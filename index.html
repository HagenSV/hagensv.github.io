        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>My name is Samuel Hagen. I started programming with python in 8th grade, mostly teaching myself. Then, as a Junior in highschool, I learned JavaScript and several key concepts of computer science in AP Computer Science Principles. I took AP Comp Sci A the following year, where I learned Java and decided to pursue a career in computer science. <a href="index.html#my-story">Click here for the full story</a></p>

        <h1 id="my-story">My Story</h1>
        <p>My first experience with programming was in 7th grade. It was a required, quarter long class that I only vaugely remember as nothing stood out to me. The next year, I had to take another quarter long programming class slightly more advanced than the previous one. In this class, we programmed in Python and on the Raspberry Pi. The last progam we made in that class was a text-based game of hangman, largely copied from the teacher's code on screen. However, something went wrong and my copy of the code wouldn't run. The quarter ended without me being able to fix it, but the problem stuck with me. That spring, I decided to revisit the problem but first I had to teach myself python. I was never able to figure out the issue, but took interest to programming and made several little games to challenge myself and expand my skillset. These games included, but were not limited to, Dreidel, BlackJack, and a survival game inspired by Minecraft, all of which were text-based. Sadly, most of these projects have been lost, and many others were never completed due to burn out from my lack of technical skills, but despite my failures, I always continued coding.

        <p>In 2021, I took AP Computer Science Principles which introduced me to several key concepts of computer science. Concepts included: binary, data compression, big O notation, fault tolerance and <a href="https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/media/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-at-a-glance.pdf">more</a>. We programmed in JavaScript on code.org's app lab. In the spring, I scored a 4 on the AP exam. The following year, I enrolled in AP Computer Science A where we learned Java. It was that year that I decided to major in computer science in college. At the end of the year, our project was to make a platformer or another program which would sufficiently demonstrate our proficienty in Java. Me and my partner decided to make a game of a different style, where the player must go around mining asteroids and selling the materials for money to upgrade their ships. Unfortunately, we ran out of time and didn't have the opportunity to add move advanced features such as enemies, but the project still met the requirements.</p>
