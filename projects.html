        <h1>Schooled (2022)</h1>
        <p class="no-indent"><b>Languages & Technologies:</b> JavaScript, Discord.js, HTML/CSS</p>
        <p>When I was in highschool, my primary mode of communication with my friends was Discord. The problem? Discord was blocked on the school wifi, and my phone plan didn't come with much data (my parents were covering it so I couldn't complain). Naturally, I created a  website and discord bot to connect to my friend's discord server and relay messages back and forth to the website of my creation. The project was severely limited in scope, the bot only interacted with one channel. From this project I learned that the network had human moderators, because my website kept getting blocked. Conviently, the website was hosted on repl.it back when they had more available for free, and simply changing the project name would give the website a new url, circumventing the network restrictions.</p>
